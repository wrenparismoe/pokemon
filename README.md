# Pokemon Battle

This was a basic pokemon battle template made in an introductory coding class from high school. The project includes three object classes and a single tester class. The four object classes are Move, Player, and Pokemon. The majority of the project is within the tester class, PokemonBattle. There the game mechanics and pokemon battle are implemented.
